**7 years of enrollment data (2018-2024).** 1.1 million students across
230+ districts in the Grand Canyon State. Here are fifteen stories
hiding in the numbers:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1. Arizona’s enrollment boom has stalled

Arizona was one of America’s fastest-growing states, but enrollment
growth has slowed dramatically. The state peaked around 2019 and has
been flat since.

``` r
library(azschooldata)
library(dplyr)

enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2011:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(end_year, n_students) %>%
  mutate(change = n_students - lag(n_students))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Mesa Unified is shrinking while Gilbert grows

Mesa Unified, once Arizona’s largest district, has lost thousands of
students while neighboring Gilbert Public Schools has surged past
40,000.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2015:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Mesa Unified|Gilbert", district_name)) %>%
  select(end_year, district_name, n_students) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = end_year, values_from = n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. COVID crushed kindergarten

Arizona kindergarten enrollment dropped over 10% during COVID and hasn’t
fully recovered, signaling smaller cohorts for years to come.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2019:2024)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level %in% c("K", "01", "06", "09")) %>%
  select(end_year, grade_level, n_students) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = grade_level, values_from = n_students)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. The Hispanic majority arrived

Hispanic students now comprise over 45% of Arizona enrollment, making
them the largest demographic group in the state’s public schools.

``` r
enr_2025 <- fetch_enr(2025)

enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("hispanic", "white", "black", "asian", "native_american", "multiracial")) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(pct * 100, 1)) %>%
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Phoenix Elementary has lost half its students

Phoenix Elementary School District, serving central Phoenix, has
hemorrhaged enrollment to charters and suburban flight over the past
decade.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2011:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Phoenix Elementary", district_name)) %>%
  select(end_year, district_name, n_students) %>%
  mutate(pct_of_peak = round(n_students / max(n_students) * 100, 1))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Charter schools serve 1 in 5 students

Arizona has the most expansive charter school sector in the nation, with
over 200,000 students–nearly 20% of all enrollment.

``` r
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(n_students)

# Charter total
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_charter, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  summarize(charter_total = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Native American enrollment is significant

Arizona has one of the nation’s largest Native American student
populations, with significant enrollment in reservation-based schools
and districts like Window Rock and Kayenta.

``` r
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "native_american", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  arrange(desc(n_students)) %>%
  head(10) %>%
  select(district_name, n_students, pct)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. The Southeast Valley is Arizona’s growth engine

Queen Creek, Chandler, and Gilbert districts in the Southeast Valley are
among the fastest-growing in the state.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2015:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Queen Creek|Chandler|Gilbert|Higley", district_name)) %>%
  group_by(district_name) %>%
  summarize(
    y2015 = n_students[end_year == 2015],
    y2025 = n_students[end_year == 2025],
    pct_change = round((y2025 / y2015 - 1) * 100, 1)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(pct_change))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9. English learners are 6% of enrollment

Arizona’s English learner population has grown with immigration and
refugee resettlement, particularly in Phoenix and Tucson.

``` r
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("lep", "total_enrollment")) %>%
  select(subgroup, n_students, pct)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10. Tucson Unified is Arizona’s second city

Tucson Unified School District, with over 40,000 students, anchors
Southern Arizona and has demographics quite different from the Phoenix
metro.

``` r
enr_2025 %>%
  filter(is_district, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         grepl("Tucson Unified", district_name),
         subgroup %in% c("total_enrollment", "hispanic", "white", "black")) %>%
  select(district_name, subgroup, n_students, pct)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 11. Rural Arizona is disappearing from the school map

While Phoenix metro booms, rural districts across Arizona are shrinking.
Counties like Greenlee, Santa Cruz, and Graham have seen enrollment drop
as families move to urban areas.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2024)
rural_counties <- c("Greenlee", "Santa Cruz", "Graham", "Gila", "Apache", "Navajo")

enr %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL",
         county %in% c(rural_counties, "Maricopa")) %>%
  mutate(region = ifelse(county == "Maricopa", "Phoenix Metro", "Rural Counties")) %>%
  group_by(end_year, region) %>%
  summarize(n_students = sum(n_students, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")
```

Metro](https://almartin82.github.io/azschooldata/articles/enrollment_hooks_files/figure-html/rural-decline-chart-1.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 12. The senior-year cliff: fewer students make it to 12th grade

Arizona sees significant enrollment drops between 9th and 12th grade.
Whether from dropouts, transfers to GED programs, or early graduation,
fewer students finish the traditional path.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, subgroup == "total_enrollment",
         grade_level %in% c("09", "10", "11", "12")) %>%
  select(end_year, grade_level, n_students) %>%
  group_by(end_year) %>%
  mutate(pct_of_9th = n_students / n_students[grade_level == "09"] * 100)
```

### 13. Special education enrollment has grown steadily

Arizona’s special education population has increased both in raw numbers
and as a percentage of total enrollment, reflecting nationwide trends in
identification and services.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("special_ed", "total_enrollment")) %>%
  select(end_year, subgroup, n_students) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = subgroup, values_from = n_students) %>%
  mutate(sped_pct = special_ed / total_enrollment * 100)
```

### 14. Arizona’s tiny districts: one-school wonders

Arizona has dozens of small districts with fewer than 500 students, many
serving rural communities, tribal lands, or specialized populations.

``` r
enr_2024 <- fetch_enr(2024)

enr_2024 %>%
  filter(is_district, subgroup == "total_enrollment", grade_level == "TOTAL") %>%
  select(district_name, county, n_students) %>%
  arrange(n_students) %>%
  head(15)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 15. Gender balance holds steady across Arizona schools

Unlike some states that see gender imbalances, Arizona’s public schools
maintain near-equal enrollment between male and female students across
all levels.

``` r
enr <- fetch_enr_multi(2018:2025)

enr %>%
  filter(is_state, grade_level == "TOTAL",
         subgroup %in% c("male", "female")) %>%
  select(end_year, subgroup, n_students) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = subgroup, values_from = n_students) %>%
  mutate(pct_male = male / (male + female) * 100)
```
